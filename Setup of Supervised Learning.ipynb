    "There are typically two steps involved in learning a hypothesis function $h()$. <br><br>First, we select the type of machine learning algorithm that we think is appropriate for this particular learning problem. This defines the hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$, i.e., the set of functions we can possibly learn. The second step is to find the best function within this class, $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$. <br><br>This second step is the actual learning process and often, but not always, involves an optimization problem. Essentially, we try to find a function $h$ within the hypothesis class that makes the fewest mistakes within our training data.

The higher the loss, the worse it is. A loss of zero means it makes perfect predictions. It is common practice to normalize the loss by the total number of training samples, $n$, so that the output can be interpreted as the average loss per sample (and is independent of $n$).\n",

    "| **Zero-One Loss**          | The simplest loss function is the zero-one loss. It literally counts how many mistakes a hypothesis function $h$ makes on the training set. For every single example, it suffers a loss of 1 if it is mispredicted, and 0 otherwise. The normalized zero-one loss returns the fraction of misclassified training samples, also often referred to as the training error. The zero-one loss is often used to evaluate classifiers in multi-class/binary classification settings but rarely useful to guide optimization procedures because the function is non-differentiable and non-continuous. | $$ \\mathcal{L}_{0/1}(h) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta\\left( h(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\neq y_i \\right), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\delta\\left( a \\right) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } h(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\neq y_i \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$ | This loss function returns the error rate on this data set $D$. For every example that the classifier misclassifies (i.e., gets wrong), a loss of 1 is suffered, whereas correctly classified samples lead to 0 loss. | Used in classification tasks, especially when the goal is simply to count misclassifications, such as in binary or multi-class classification problems. This loss is simple but not differentiable, which makes it difficult to optimize directly. |\n",
    "| **Squared Loss**           | The squared loss function is typically used in regression settings. It iterates over all training samples and suffers the loss $(h(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i)^2$. The squaring has two effects: 1., the loss suffered is always nonnegative; 2., the loss suffered grows quadratically with the absolute mispredicted amount. The latter property encourages no predictions to be really far off (or the penalty would be so large that a different hypothesis function is likely better suited). On the flip side, if a prediction is very close to be correct, the square will be tiny and little attention will be given to that example to obtain zero error. For example, if $|h(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i| = 0.001$ the squared loss will be even smaller, $0.000001$, and will likely never be fully corrected. If, given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, the label $y$ is probabilistic according to some distribution $P(y|\\mathbf{x})$ then the optimal prediction to minimize the squared loss is to predict the expected value, i.e. $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbb{E}_{P(y|\\mathbf{x})}[y]$. | $$ \\mathcal{L}_\\text{sq}(h) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (h(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i)^2 $$ | The squaring has two effects: first, the loss is always non-negative, and second, the penalty increases quadratically as the error grows. This property is useful because it discourages large mispredictions and focuses on getting those predictions right. | Commonly used in regression tasks such as predicting house prices or temperatures. Squaring the error is beneficial as it focuses on minimizing larger errors, which often leads to a better fit and smoother predictions. |\n",
    "| **Absolute Loss**          | Similar to the squared loss, the absolute loss function is also typically used in regression settings. It suffers the penalties $|h(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i|$. Because the suffered loss grows linearly with the mispredictions it is more suitable for noisy data (when some mispredictions are unavoidable and shouldn’t dominate the loss). If, given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, the label $y$ is probabilistic according to some distribution $P(y|\\mathbf{x})$ then the optimal prediction to minimize the absolute loss is to predict the median value, i.e. $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\text{MEDIAN}_{P(y|\\mathbf{x})}[y]$. | $$ \\mathcal{L}_\\text{abs}(h) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n |h(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i| $$ | Because the loss grows linearly with mispredictions, it doesn’t penalize large errors as much as squared loss. It’s more robust in situations where there is noisy data or when mispredictions are unavoidable. | Used in regression when there is noise in the data and you want to avoid letting extreme outliers unduly affect the model, such as in financial predictions or robust modeling. |\n",
    "| **Logarithmic Loss**       | Used for binary classification problems, evaluates how well the predicted probabilities match the true labels. | $$ \\mathcal{L}_\\text{log}(h) = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i \\log(h(\\mathbf{x}_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h(\\mathbf{x}_i)) \\right) $$                                            | This formula is used when the output is a probability, as in binary classification. It penalizes predictions based on how far off the predicted probability is from the actual class label. | Commonly used in binary classification tasks such as spam detection, medical diagnoses, and other tasks involving probability-based predictions. Logarithmic loss is effective because it maximizes the likelihood of the correct class, and thus works well when predicting probabilities rather than hard labels. |\n",
    "| **Hinge Loss**             | Used for classification tasks, particularly with support vector machines, penalizes misclassifications and allows for margin of error. | $$ \\mathcal{L}_\\text{hinge}(h) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\max(0, 1 - y_i h(\\mathbf{x}_i)) $$                                        | The hinge loss is commonly used in classification models like support vector machines. It penalizes predictions that are on the wrong side of the decision boundary, but allows for some margin of error. | Used in classification tasks, particularly with support vector machines (SVMs) for binary or multi-class classification, such as text classification or image classification. Hinge loss is useful because it enforces a margin of error, promoting a larger gap between classes and improving generalization. |\n",

    "   - **Math Definition:** The pair of data points $(x, y)$ are sampled from the probability distribution $\\mathcal{P}$.\n",
    "   - **Colloquial English:** This means that the inputs $x$ (features) and outputs $y$ (labels) are generated by the same underlying process or pattern (distribution) $\\mathcal{P}$.\n",

    "3. **$L(h; (x, y))$:**\n",

    "1. <b>Training Set (D<sub>train</sub>):</b> Used for model training. The model learns patterns and relationships between features and labels.  \n",
    "2. <b>Validation Set (D<sub>val</sub>):</b> Helps in model selection and hyperparameter tuning, providing feedback for optimization.  \n",
    "3. <b>Test Set (D<sub>test</sub>):</b> Offers an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color: crimson;\">Important Principles for Splitting with Scientific Examples:</b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Temporal Data:</b> When data has a time-dependent structure (e.g., spam filtering, stock prices), it is crucial to split by time to avoid future information leaking into training.  \n",
    "  - <b>Scientific Depth:</b> In spam filtering, emails often appear in clusters over time as spammers send the same message to multiple users. A random split might place nearly identical emails in both the training and test sets, artificially inflating performance metrics. To address this, split based on the temporal order of data collection, ensuring the model learns from past data to predict future events—a closer reflection of real-world deployment conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>i.i.d. Data:</b> For datasets assumed to be independent and identically distributed, random splitting is appropriate. However, ensure the splitting method does not introduce bias inadvertently.  \n",
    "  - <b>Scientific Depth:</b> For example, if data points are stored sequentially by label (e.g., all samples of class \"1\" followed by class \"0\"), a naive split could result in one class being entirely in the test set. This would lead to a biased evaluation where the model has no exposure to certain classes during training. Random shuffling before splitting ensures all classes are proportionally represented in both sets, adhering to the i.i.d. assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Grouped Data:</b> In datasets with inherent group structures (e.g., patient records, households), ensure entire groups are placed exclusively in training or testing.  \n",
    "  - <b>Scientific Depth:</b> Patient data often includes multiple samples (e.g., MRI scans, blood tests) for the same individual. If such samples are split randomly, the model could indirectly \"learn\" about the test data by memorizing patient-specific patterns from the training set. This results in overestimation of model performance. Assigning entire patients to either training or testing prevents such leakage, ensuring the model generalizes to unseen individuals rather than memorizing intra-group similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color: teal;\">Overfitting on the Test Set:</b>  \n",
    "Repeatedly evaluating multiple models on the test set introduces selection bias, as the final model is implicitly optimized on the test data.  \n",
    "<b style=\"color: crimson;\">Solution:</b>  \n",
    "Introduce a validation set to guide model selection and reserve the test set for a single, final evaluation of generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Scientific Example:</b>  \n",
    "Consider testing a face recognition model on a dataset where the test set consists of 100 faces, and the model initially misclassifies 5. If the model is iteratively fine-tuned to correct these 5 misclassifications, its apparent error rate drops to 0%. However, this improvement is often due to overfitting on the specific test set, not genuine generalization. By introducing a validation set, the model can be refined without compromising the test set's role as an unbiased estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color: darkorange;\">Additional Notes:</b>  \n",
    "- <b>Split Ratios:</b> A common split is 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test.  \n",
    "- <b>Small Datasets:</b> Techniques like leave-one-out cross-validation are useful for datasets with limited samples.  \n",
    "- <b>Variance and Bias:</b> Larger test sets provide lower variance in error estimates but reduce the amount of data available for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Scientific Example:</b>  \n",
    "In small datasets, such as those involving rare diseases, every sample is valuable. Leave-one-out cross-validation ensures the model is trained on as much data as possible while providing an unbiased error estimate. For example, in an MRI-based diagnostic study with only 11 patients, the model can be trained on 10 patients and tested on the remaining one, repeating the process for all patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color: darkblue;\">Key Takeaway:</b>  \n",
    "Machine learning requires assumptions about the data, such as independence, temporal structure, or group-level organization. The success of an algorithm depends on its ability to leverage these assumptions effectively. No single algorithm works best for all scenarios, so understanding data properties is crucial for selecting the right model.\n",
